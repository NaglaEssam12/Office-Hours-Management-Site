# Office-Hours-Management-Site 
# Description
  Due to Covid-19 pandemic and other conditions managing office hours for staff members (Drs. 
  And Tas.) became a hectic problem with a rising difficulty for the student to keep track and 
  know the available office hours. This project tries to address this problem.
  There are two user groups which are “Students” and “staff Members.
  For each member there are some functionalities:
    Student :- Find staff of each subject. Reserve an appointment with staff member at specific slot and date.
                    Message staff member of specific subject (specific TA, Dr or all subject Tas) directly
    Staff Member :- View and reply to students’ messages. Cancel slot reservations on a specific date or all the slots on a certain day
               Get notifications of messages and students’ reservation by email.
